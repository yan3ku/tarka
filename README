commentary:
The backups are stored as encrypted LZMA tar files. Incremental backups are done
using the -g tar option. Rsync is used to compress the files on the fly when
transferring them to/from the repository. If an SSH repository is used, the
script handles the decryption in a separate fetch directory on the host. Each
full backup receives a unique identifier, which is inherited by subsequent
incremental backups. Don't forget to run check periodically to verify against
corruption.
